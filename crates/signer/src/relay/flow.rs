//! The background half of the backend: driving one upstream order to a
//! certificate, and settling the local order once it resolves.
//!
//! Everything here runs *after* `issue` has already answered the client with
//! `processing` (RFC 8555 §7.4), in a job that owns the local `Order` from then
//! on. That is why these functions take the backend's `Inner` — with its
//! database handle and notifier — rather than reaching through an `AppState`:
//! there is no request in scope any more, and nothing here can report a failure
//! by returning it to anyone.
//!
//! ## Why this is safe to run again
//!
//! [`RelayJob`] is a [`acme_proxy_jobs::jobs::JobHandler`], so the runner may call it
//! repeatedly for one order: after a transient failure, and after a process
//! died mid-flight. Nothing here checkpoints its own progress, and it does not
//! need to — every step re-reads the upstream's own view and skips what is
//! already done ([`poll_until`] accepts a `pending`/`ready`/`valid` order and the
//! authorization loops `continue` past anything not `pending`). RFC 8555 lets an
//! order be re-read at any time, which is what makes "start from the top" and
//! "carry on" the same code.
//!
//! ## Retryable versus permanent
//!
//! [`RelayFailure`] is the distinction the old code could not make: it returned
//! `Result<String, String>`, so a TCP reset mid-poll invalidated the order as
//! surely as a CA refusing the name. The rule is *whose* answer it is — a
//! network, a proxy or an overloaded CA has not decided anything, so ask again;
//! a CA that stated a reason has, so believe it.
