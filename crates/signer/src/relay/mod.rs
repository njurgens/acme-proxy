//! A signer backend that relays issuance to a real upstream ACME server.
//!
//! Where [`local_ca`](crate::local_ca) *is* the CA, this backend makes
//! the server a **proxy**: clients keep speaking ordinary ACME to it and keep
//! proving domain control to it, but the certificate itself is obtained from an
//! upstream ACME server — another `acme-proxy`, a private enterprise CA, or a
//! public CA — of which this server becomes a client.
//!
//! ## Two independent proof cycles
//!
//! The local validation flow does not change: that is what justifies the proxy
//! existing at all. What changes is only what happens *after* the local order
//! reaches `ready`. The upstream has its own opinion about domain control, and
//! this server — not the original client — must satisfy it, because the
//! upstream account is this server's. See [`ChallengeStrategy`].
//!
//! ## Asynchronous by necessity
//!
//! An upstream validation cycle can take minutes. Holding the client's
//! `finalize` request open for that long would tie up a connection and a SQLite
//! handle, so [`RelaySigner::issue`] returns [`IssueOutcome::Processing`] and
//! finishes later. RFC 8555 §7.4 has the `processing` order status for exactly
//! this, and the client polls. Whatever finishes it owns the `Order` from then
//! on: it calls `Order::finalize` on success and `Order::mark_invalid` on
//! failure, which is why this backend needs an `Arc<Database>` where `local_ca`
//! needs none.
//!
//! That "later" is a row in the [`acme_proxy_jobs::jobs`] queue, not a `tokio::spawn`.
//! `issue` enqueues a [`flow::RelayJob`] and the process-wide runner claims it —
//! which is what gives a relay an attempt count, a backoff and a lease it did
//! not have when this backend ran its own task and its own startup sweep. The
//! practical difference is that a transient upstream failure now retries instead
//! of invalidating the order, and a crashed process's work is reclaimed by
//! lease expiry rather than only by a restart.
