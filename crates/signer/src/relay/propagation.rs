//! Waiting for a published `dns-01` record to be served before the upstream is
//! asked to look at it.
//!
//! ## Why the relay waits at all
//!
//! An RFC 2136 NOERROR says the update server *accepted* the record, not that
//! the nameservers the CA will ask are *serving* it: a provider bridging the
//! update to an API answers before its edge has the value, and a primary's
//! secondaries catch up by NOTIFY and IXFR. Triggering in that window is not a
//! cheap retry here. Once the upstream looks and finds nothing, the
//! authorization is `invalid` for good, which [`super::flow`] maps to a
//! permanent failure of the client's order — and a public CA counts it against
//! its failed-validation limit.
//!
//! ## Why a fixed delay, and not a poll
//!
//! The tempting check — ask a public resolver until the value appears — asks
//! the wrong server. The CA resolves through the zone's authoritative
//! nameservers itself; a recursive resolver answers from whichever one it
//! happened to reach, and caches a "no such record" from a lagging one for the
//! zone's negative TTL, failing every later poll. It also never succeeds for an
//! internal or split-horizon zone. A fixed delay is right everywhere, needs no
//! DNS logic, and is the model certbot's DNS plugins use. Polling each
//! authoritative nameserver directly is the sound check, and would be another
//! variant here rather than a change to this one.
