//! [`challenge::http_01`](crate::challenge::http_01),
//! `signer::relay::client`,
//! `ipam::http` and

//! *plumbing*: pick a URL apart into host, scheme and port; connect through the

//! What differs is *policy*, and each of those modules' comment defending

//! `http_01` must **not** validate the peer certificate (RFC 8555 §8.3 — what
