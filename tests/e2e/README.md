# End-to-end test suite

Real ACME clients (certbot, acme.sh, lego) driven against a real `acme-proxy`,
entirely inside containers started by [`testcontainers-rs`](https://docs.rs/testcontainers).
**Docker or Podman is the only prerequisite** — clients run from images built
from the `Containerfile`s in this tree, and `acme-proxy`/the DNS test server
are built the same way, so nothing needs installing on the host beyond the
container runtime itself.

Beyond the REST-flow checks (register/order/update/deactivate against
`challenge.bypass = true`, the default), this suite covers what a host-based
suite could not without root or extra tooling:

- **dns-01**: needs a real DNS server the test controls, publishing records
  the moment a client asks for one.
- **tls-alpn-01** and **http-01 on their real default ports** (443/80):
  binding a privileged port on the bare host needs root. A container's own
  root can bind <1024 with no host privilege at all (isolated network
  namespace), so this suite exercises the real defaults rather than a
  remapped port.
- **EAB**: needs a key actually provisioned through the admin CLI and a
  server actually configured with `eab.enabled = true` to prove enforcement
  — see "Why `eab.rs` isn't a hardcoded credential" below.
- **`reverse_dns`**: needs a real PTR record, and one client address with a
  forward-confirmed PTR and one address genuinely without one, to prove the
  filter's Denied-vs-Internal split actually works against a real resolver —
  see "reverse_dns: a real bug it caught" below.
- **Admin CLI**: proving `acme-proxy account list`/`order list` reflect
  reality means running them against a database a real client has actually
  written to, not a hand-seeded one.
- **Key rollover**: needs a client that will actually perform RFC 8555
  §7.3.5's nested-JWS dance — see "key_change.rs: the one client left that
  still does this" below.

## Running

```bash
cargo nextest run -E 'binary(e2e)' --run-ignored all   # every scenario
cargo test --test e2e -- --ignored                      # or plain cargo test
```

Every test in this suite is `#[ignore]`d, so a plain `cargo nextest run`/
`cargo test` skips all of them — `-E 'binary(e2e)' --run-ignored all` (or
`--test e2e -- --ignored` with plain `cargo test`) is required to actually
run them. CI runs only the three challenge scenarios, and only nightly (the
`e2e` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `if: github.event_name == 'schedule'`);
everything else here is a manual check.

The first run of any test builds eight images (`bind-e2e`, `acme-proxy-e2e`,
`netbox-mock-e2e`, `phpipam-mock-e2e`, `azure-mock-e2e`, `certbot-e2e`,
`acmesh-e2e`, `lego-e2e`), guarded by a
cross-process `flock` so nextest's one-process-per-test model doesn't race
the same `podman build`/`docker build` from multiple tests at once; every
later test in the same run reuses those images. Each test then gets its own
dedicated network and set of containers (`Lab::new` in `common.rs`), torn
down when the test's `Lab` is dropped.

Because `ensure_images_built`'s skip guard is keyed on `NEXTEST_RUN_ID` (a
fresh id every run — see its comment), the seven `build` commands are reissued
on *every* invocation, not just the first ever; whether anything actually
recompiles is entirely down to the container engine's own layer cache. Three
of the images compile Rust, and they do it two different ways.

`acme-proxy-e2e`, from the root `Containerfile`, is the one on the inner loop —
it rebuilds whenever the crate changes, which is most of the time — so it is
the one that got tuned. Three things keep it cheap, and all three are needed:

- **The build context is an allowlist.** The root `.dockerignore` admits
  `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `src/` and `crates/`, and nothing else. It
  used to be a blocklist of nine paths, which let `doc/`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md` and `config.toml.example` through — so editing prose invalidated
  `COPY . .` and forced a full recompile. Adding a file the build genuinely
  needs means adding a `!` line there.
- **`RUN --mount=type=cache`** keeps the cargo registry and `target/` across
  builds. `COPY . .` invalidates its own layer on any source change, so
  anything living *in* a layer starts from nothing every time; a cache mount
  does not, which is what makes the rebuild incremental. This replaced a
  four-stage [`cargo-chef`](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/cargo-chef)
  split, which cached the *dependency* build and left the crate's own build —
  the expensive half, at roughly two minutes of fat-LTO relink — uncached.
  A persistent `target/` subsumes what chef was buying. Note this needs
  BuildKit if you point `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` at docker with the legacy builder.
- **`--profile e2e`** (`[profile.e2e]` in the root `Cargo.toml`) is release
  without fat LTO and with 16 codegen units. `opt-level` stays at 3, because
  `challenge.timeout_ms` and friends are real budgets these scenarios run
  against. The lab asks for it with `--build-arg CARGO_PROFILE=e2e`; the
  `Containerfile`'s own default is `release`, the build that is published.
  So a bare `podman build .` is **not** the lab's build: it is a fat-LTO,
  one-codegen-unit build that takes tens of minutes. Pass the argument
  when you build the lab image by hand.

Measured on a 20-core host: ~2m10s from a completely cold cache (every
dependency compiled), ~7s after a source change — the crate is a single
compilation unit, so that is a full recompile of it, just an incremental,
non-LTO one — and ~3s, an all-layers-cached no-op, after a documentation
change. The arrangement this replaced spent ~2m15s on the last of those
three. End to end, the 34 scenarios run in about 50 seconds against warm
images; they took roughly seven minutes before this and the `certbot renew`
sleep below were dealt with.

`netbox-mock-e2e` and `phpipam-mock-e2e` keep the plain cargo-chef split.
They are two-file crates whose sources change about once a quarter, so the
inner-loop problem does not apply; what did apply to them was the build
context, and `tests/e2e/.dockerignore` now keeps `netbox-mock/target`
(128 MB, and `COPY`ed into the image twice) out of a context that six of the
seven builds ship. Every stage in every Containerfile under this
directory (and the root one) is `FROM debian:trixie-slim` on purpose, with no
upstream language images and no third-party images — keep it that way rather
than reaching for `rust:*`/`golang:*`/`alpine:*`/`lukemathwalker/cargo-chef:*`
in a future edit. Three of the seven install their tool from source/tarball
instead of `apt` because trixie's packaged version isn't new enough:
`rustc`/`cargo` (1.85 main / 1.94 backports, below this crate's
`rust-version = "1.97"` MSRV) come from `rustup`; Go (trixie's `golang-go` is
1.24, below `lego`'s `go 1.25.0` requirement) comes from the pinned, checksum-
verified tarball at `go.dev/dl`; `acme.sh` has no Debian package at all, so
it's a pinned upstream release tarball, the same reasoning `lego.Containerfile`
already uses for `lego` itself (see "key_change.rs" below).

## Design

`tests/e2e/common.rs`'s `Lab` is the harness every scenario builds on:

- **Image building** (`ensure_images_built`) resolves the container runtime
  (`docker` if present, else `podman`; overridable via `CONTAINER_RUNTIME`),
  points `DOCKER_HOST` at the rootless-Podman socket if it isn't already
  set — failing with a clear message if `podman.socket` isn't already
  active rather than starting it itself — and builds all eight images once
  per run behind the flock described above.
- **`Lab::new(env)`** starts a dedicated bridge network plus `dns`,
  `acme-proxy`, `certbot`, `acme-sh` and `lego` containers, and — only when
  the scenario asks for one — `netbox-mock` and `phpipam-mock`. "Asks for one"
  means some value in `env` contains the `NETBOX_IP`/`PHPIPAM_IP` placeholder,
  which is already the only way a scenario can reach a mock's address; the
  need is derived from that rather than declared separately, so there is no
  second list to forget. Four of the scenarios want an inventory and the rest
  no longer pay a container and a `podman inspect` each for two they never
  talk to. Whatever is wanted — the mocks and, under `new_with_upstream`, the
  second `acme-proxy` — starts in a single `tokio::join!`, since none of them
  needs another's address; the proxy is the one container that has to wait,
  because its environment names all of them.
  `env` is a list of `ACME_PROXY_*` environment variables passed straight to
  the `acme-proxy` container — every scenario knob (`challenge.enabled`,
  `challenge.bypass`, `eab.enabled`, `dns.resolver`, `server.tls.enabled`,
  ...) is an existing config key, so no server code changes are needed to
  make a new scenario testable. A few placeholder tokens
  (`DNS_SERVER_HOST`, `CERTBOT_IP`, `ACMESH_IP`, `LEGO_IP`, `NETBOX_IP`,
  `UPSTREAM_URL`) get substituted with the actual container addresses once
  they're known, so a test can reference "the certbot container's address"
  before that address exists.
- **`Lab::new_with_upstream`** additionally starts a second `acme-proxy`
  instance (for the `relay` relaying signer backend) and
  **`Lab::new_with_files`** copies files into the primary `acme-proxy`
  container *before* it starts, via testcontainers' `with_copy_to` — for
  scenarios like the `custom` signer where `signer.custom.script_path` must
  exist at startup, not be injected into an already-running (and possibly
  already-failed-to-start) container.
- **`exec_in`/`exec_in_with_output`** run a script inside a given container
  (`sh -c <script>`, passed as a single argv element — no host-shell
  quoting to worry about, so multi-line scripts and even raw file contents
  with embedded newlines can be passed directly; no `echo`/backslash-escape
  tricks needed).
- **`get_proxy_logs`/`get_proxy_upstream_logs`/`get_netbox_mock_logs`/
  `get_phpipam_mock_logs`** grep a
  container's log for a marker proving something real happened — the same
  pattern the unit suite uses (e.g. `challenge_dns_01_matched`,
  `certificate_revoked`, `account_key_changed`).
- **`dns_add_a`/`dns_add_ptr`** push real records into the `dns` (BIND)
  container via `nsupdate` over RFC 2136 + TSIG, the same mechanism
  `acme-proxy` itself would use for a real deployment.

## What each scenario proves

- **`certbot.rs`** — the full account lifecycle through certbot: register,
  show account, order, revoke, renew, unregister (deactivate). The renew
  scenario passes **`--no-random-sleep-on-renew`**, which is mandatory rather
  than tidy: certbot's renew path sleeps `random.uniform(1, 60 * 8)` — one to
  eight minutes — whenever `sys.stdin.isatty()` is false, and it never is
  under `podman exec`. That is there to spread real clients across Let's
  Encrypt and buys nothing against a CA in a container on the same host.
  Unnoticed, it averaged four minutes and made the suite's total a coin flip;
  any new `certbot renew` call site needs the same flag.
- **`acme_sh.rs`** — the same lifecycle through acme.sh: register, order,
  update account contact, deactivate account.
- **`http_01.rs`** / **`dns_01.rs`** / **`tls_alpn_01.rs`** — real challenge
  validation per type (`challenge.bypass = false`), each grepping
  `get_proxy_logs()` for that validator's own success marker
  (`challenge_http_01_matched`, `challenge_dns_01_matched`,
  `challenge_tls_alpn_01_matched`) so a scenario can only pass if the server
  actually ran real validation, not because bypass was left on. See
  "tls-alpn-01: a third client, and real TLS" below for why `tls_alpn_01.rs`
  uses lego instead of certbot/acme.sh.
- **`key_change.rs`** — `POST /keyChange` (RFC 8555 §7.3.5) via lego's
  `accounts keyrollover`. See "key_change.rs: the one client left that still
  does this" below.
- **`eab.rs`** — External Account Binding: a key actually provisioned via
  `acme-proxy eab create`, checked against both the negative case (no EAB
  fields → `externalAccountRequired`) and the positive case for both
  certbot and acme.sh. See "Why `eab.rs` isn't a hardcoded credential" below.
- **`filters.rs`** — one allowed and one denied case per filter
  (`allowed_ip`, `identifiers`, `reverse_dns`, `custom`, `ipam`).
  `allowed_ip`/`reverse_dns` are connection-level filters — they block even
  the unauthenticated `GET /directory` — so their denied case is checked
  with a direct `curl` from inside the denied client's own container rather
  than through the client itself: acme.sh in particular treats an
  unexpected 403 there as transient and burns time retrying before
  surfacing a client-internal error that has nothing to do with the
  server's (correct) refusal. `identifiers` denies at `newOrder`, which
  needs a fully authenticated, signed request, so it drives a real
  `certbot certonly` for both cases and greps certbot's own paraphrase of
  the problem document ("denied by policy") rather than the raw ACME error
  type, since that's what certbot actually prints. `custom` writes a real
  shell script into the `acme-proxy` container (`ACME_FILTER_*` env
  contract) and denies one identifier by name. The `ipam` filter gets three
  scenarios, against the `netbox-mock` and `phpipam-mock` services (small
  Rust `axum` servers answering the endpoints each backend calls — a real
  NetBox is postgres + redis + the application, out of all proportion for
  testing one filter):
  - `test_netbox` proves both the direct IP-object match (certbot owns
    `allowed.example.com`) and the device-fallback path (acme.sh owns
    `machine.example.com` only through the *device* its address is assigned
    to) are wired to real HTTP requests, not just a stub — the denied case
    asks for `machine.example.com` from certbot, a name that exists in
    NetBox and another client legitimately owns, proving the filter binds
    names to the asking address rather than pooling everything NetBox knows.
  - `test_netbox_fhrp_group_membership` turns on the `vip` and `fhrp`
    sources. acme.sh's interface is recorded in FHRP group 41, which holds
    `service.example.com`, and certbot's is in no group: both ask for that
    name and only acme.sh gets it. This is the membership property the source
    exists for — a group is reachable only through an assignment naming the
    client's own interface, never by the name being requested. acme.sh's
    device also carries a role-tagged VIP, so `vip` is exercised in the same
    run.
  - `test_phpipam` is `test_netbox`'s mirror against the other product.
  - `test_phpipam_unknown_address` covers the one behaviour that genuinely
    differs: an address phpIPAM has never heard of answers `404`, which must
    **deny** the order rather than 500 it. It is a separate, TLS-enabled lab
    because lego is the only container the phpIPAM mock holds no row for, and
    lego refuses a plain-HTTP ACME server outright — the same reason
    `key_change.rs` and `tls_alpn_01.rs` enable TLS for their lego runs. Any
    new lego scenario needs `ACME_PROXY_SERVER__TLS__ENABLED=true` plus
    `--tls-skip-verify`, and `lego run` takes its flags *after* the
    subcommand, not before it.
- **`profiles.rs`** — two ACME endpoints (`default`/`second`) in one
  process: cross-profile isolation, per-profile CAs and filters, distinct
  CRLs.
- **`admin_cli.rs`** — registers and orders through certbot, then runs
  `acme-proxy account list --json`/`order list --json` inside the *running*
  `acme-proxy` container and asserts the output names the same contact and
  identifier the client used — proving the admin CLI reads the same
  database a real deployment would, not a hand-seeded fixture. Like `eab
  create`, its tracing output lands on stdout ahead of its own JSON, so the
  test pulls out the line that looks like JSON rather than assuming the
  whole output parses.
- **`custom_signer.rs`** — `signer.backend = "custom"`, delegating issuance
  to a real, self-contained `openssl`-backed script (not a stub) copied into
  the `acme-proxy` container via `Lab::new_with_files` before it starts. The
  issued leaf's issuer is checked against the script's own CA, proving
  delegation actually happened rather than falling back to `local_ca`'s
  default one.
- **`relay_signer.rs`** — the relaying `relay` signer backend
  against a second `acme-proxy` instance (`Lab::new_with_upstream`), both
  the `bypass` and `dns01` upstream challenge strategies.
- **`ari.rs`** — `GET /renewalInfo/{certID}` (RFC 9773): a real certificate
  is issued, its serial extracted with `openssl`, and the resulting ARI URL
  is checked for a `suggestedWindow`.

## Why `eab.rs` isn't a hardcoded credential

An earlier version of this check sent a hardcoded kid/HMAC pair that was
never created through `acme-proxy eab create` and ran against a server left
at the default `eab.enabled = false` — so even executed by hand it never
validated server-side enforcement. `eab.rs` provisions a real key via the
admin CLI against a server with EAB actually turned on.

## tls-alpn-01: a third client, and real TLS

Neither certbot nor acme.sh implement a tls-alpn-01 responder (unlike
http-01/dns-01, which both expose hooks a script can drive). lego
(`github.com/go-acme/lego`) does, via `--tls`, so it's used as a
supplementary third tool for `tls_alpn_01.rs` — not a replacement for
certbot/acme.sh anywhere else in this suite.

`tls_alpn_01.rs` is also the one `http_01`/`dns_01`/`tls_alpn_01` scenario
that turns `server.tls.enabled` on: lego refuses a plain-http directory URL
outright (an unconditional check with no bypass flag, unlike certbot/acme.sh
which tolerate it), so `acme-proxy` serves HTTPS with the self-signed
certificate `tls::from_config` generates on first run, and lego is given
`--tls-skip-verify` to accept it.

## key_change.rs: the one client left that still does this

RFC 8555 §7.3.5 account key rollover used to have client-driven coverage via
acme.sh's `--update-account-key`. That flag no longer exists: acme.sh
removed it with no replacement (confirmed by grepping the installed
script's own `--help` output and source — no `--update-account-key`,
`--rotate-account-key`, or any other rollover command remains). certbot has
never had it — its vendored `acme` library (`acme.messages`/`acme.client`)
implements no key-change request at all (confirmed the same way: nothing
matching `key`/`change`/`rollover` in either module), and the feature
request (certbot/certbot#9761) has sat open and unplanned.

lego added `accounts keyrollover` in v5.0.0 (go-acme/lego#2950). Alpine's
`lego` package is still on the 4.x line (which predates it), so
`tests/e2e/lego.Containerfile` builds a pinned v5.3.1 release from source
instead of `apk add lego` — the same version the pre-rewrite shell suite
pinned as `docker.io/goacme/lego:v5.3.1`, which is presumably why this went
unnoticed until the client images were rebuilt locally. `key_change.rs`
issues a certificate, rolls the account key over (`lego accounts
keyrollover`, confirmed non-interactively with a piped `Y`), then issues a
second certificate on the same account to prove the *new* key is what
actually works afterward, not just that lego believes the rollover
succeeded — the same "prove the real effect" pattern every other scenario
here relies on (`get_proxy_logs()` for the `account_key_changed` marker).

## reverse_dns: a real bug it caught

Running this for the first time caught a real, pre-existing bug: `certbot`
(with a PTR record) passed immediately, but `acme-sh` (without one) got a
**500** instead of the expected 403. `reverse_dns.rs`'s unit tests
deliberately distinguish "no PTR record" (`FilterError::Denied`, the
client's fault) from "the resolver failed" (`FilterError::Internal`, ours)
— but `HickoryResolver::reverse`/`forward`/`txt` (`crates/net/src/dns.rs`) surfaced
*both* NXDOMAIN and an empty NOERROR answer as `Err`, never as `Ok` with
zero records, so the "no PTR record" branch was unreachable outside of a
test using a hand-written stub. Every existing Rust unit test for
`reverse_dns` does exactly that — stubs the resolver by hand — so nothing
had ever exercised this against a real one before. Fixed by checking
hickory's own `NetError::is_no_records_found()` in all three methods before
treating a lookup failure as an error; `dns_01.rs`'s server-side validator
was never affected, since both cases already mapped to the same
`ChallengeError::Dns` there.

## Known gaps / follow-up (not in this pass)

- **`server.tls.enabled`** as a feature in its own right (independent of
  what `tls_alpn_01.rs` needs to make lego work) isn't exercised here.
- A hand-built-JWS scenario for certbot's key rollover (using its vendored
  `acme.jws`/`josepy` libraries directly, since its CLI exposes no command)
  was prototyped and works, but wasn't kept: it would mean re-implementing
  a meaningful slice of this server's own JWS logic inside the test rather
  than exercising a real client's own documented interface, and
  `key_change.rs` already gets equivalent real-client coverage more cheaply
  via lego.
